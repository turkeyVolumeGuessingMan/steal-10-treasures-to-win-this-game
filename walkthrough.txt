A dark oak slab of door hangs on wide iron hinges. Perched high above on the wall is a gargoyle, making a goofy smirk.
Next to the door is a cheery little doorbell.
> I want to ring the doorbell
(p key)
A merry chime rings from inside the castle.
Moments later, a staticky speaker comes to life inside the gargoyle above your head:
“Greetings adventurer! No doubt you've come to plunder this dangerous castle for treasure. To make you feel welcome, enjoy this very safe (and not poisoned) ice cream cone.”
A small hatch opens near the door, and a stone hand emerges holding a delicious ice cream cone.
Press l to lick, s to sniff, or p to push the ice cream cone away.
> refuse the ice cream cone
(p key)
“Hey!” crackles the gargoyle speaker. “Why would anyone refuse free ice cream? It's irresistible!”

The cannonball sails through the window of the next tower over, followed by a loud thundering CRASH!
Moments later an overjoyed owl flaps into the room. “Thank you, kind adventurer!” hoots the owl. “Because of you, I am free of that loathsome cage.” He drops a whistle into your open palm. “In this castle are many diabolical traps and puzzles. Should you encounter a riddle beyond your comprehension, blow this whistle and I will come assist. Farewell!”
He flaps off into the night.
